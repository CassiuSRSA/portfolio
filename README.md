# My Portfolio

This is currently my main portfolio.

## Technology used

I mainly used HTML and CSS for this project, with a little dash of JS to get the cards to function as I wanted then to function.

For the the form I initially used a PHP file, however, found a more workable method by using FormSubmit.co.
